# BDA_Udemy_Course_Recommendation_System_Mini_project

### Problem Statement of the mini project:-

To build a recommendation app, that recommends the courses from Udemy to the person using streamlit for frontend and Udemy Dataset, 
based on their given interest the app will guide them the courses along with the given Course ID, Course title, URL link, and 
various other information will be shown for better decision making. 



###Conclusion:-

With the help of Big data analysis we were able to execute queries on a huge dataset like the one we have used on for our course 
recommendation app. We have used Cosine similarity which is a metric used to measure how similar two items are. Mathematically, 
it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. The output value ranges from 0â€“1.
0 means no similarity, where as 1 means that both the items are 100% similar. Therefore we successfully built a recommendation app,
that recommends the courses from Udemy to the person using streamlit for frontend and Udemy Dataset, based on their given interest 
the app will guide them the courses along with the given Course ID, Course title, URL link, and various other information will be 
shown for better decision making.
